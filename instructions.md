# Instructions for Students

Welcome to your website! 

Each group will work together to create a document in the programming language called markdown. Then one group member will paste that markdown file on top of the template for your group's song. 

## Step 1: Understanding Markdown

Markdown is the name for when you add a set of specific characters to the text in order to generate a different look-and-feel on a published web page. For example on [the markdown file for this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaranth-unm/music-history/refs/heads/main/instructions.md), the heading used just above, for 'Step 1: Understanding Markdown' has two hashtags in front of it so that on the published website it displays in a different style from the main body text. 

Using markdown is very easy because knowing only a few of these little characters gives you a lot of power over the look-and-feel of your web page. 

For a handy concise list of common markdown characters, visit the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

The most handy resource for you in this project will be a resource created by the Amaranth team, called [Xanthan](https://amaranth-unm.github.io/xanthan//components/typography).

Your group will work together to create a document using markdown in order to generate a webpage about your song. Create a shared document on a cloud space, such as Google Drive or One Drive. The person in your group in charge of publishing the markdown document on this website will be able to help you check to see what the page looks like as you work.

## Step 2: Managing Image Files

Save all your images into a shared folder in a cloud location such as Google Drive or One Drive. 

When you download an image for inclusion on your webpage, please change its name according to the following instructions:

- Rename the image to reflect its content.
- Do not use capital letters or spaces in image file names. 
- Please rename the file so that it is all lowercase and there are hypens in between words. (Example: big-image-of-the-band.jpg)
- When you reference your image in the markdown file, ensure that the image file extension matches exactly the file you uploaded. Your image will not work if you type jpg instead of png or jpeg at the end of the file name. Use copy-paste to avoid this.
